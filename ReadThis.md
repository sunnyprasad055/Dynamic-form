To start dynamic form run command "npm run sunny" in the terminal.
To create this form I used Dependencies @material-ui/core, axios, concurrently, json-server additionally
material-ui/core is for general styling purposes of the form
axios is to https request of data 
concurrently is used run both json-server and react app simantaniouly on the web browser
json-server is to store form data in the server
